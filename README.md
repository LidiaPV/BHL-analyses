# BHL-Thesis

## BACKGROUND

These data files accompany my doctoral thesis, "Virtual Bio-Diverse Relationships and Digital Knowledges: Latin America in and through the Biodiversity Heritage Library" as a partial requirement for my Ph.D. in Hispanic Studies at McGill University as well as subsequent research projects and publications. These files include metadata extracted from the database and catalogue of the *Biodiversity Heritage Library* (BHL). Several of these files are also available through [BHL's GitHub repository](https://github.com/gbhl/bhl-us-data-sets/tree/master/Metadata-LatinAmerica) as I produced them as part of an internship research project in the summer of 2021. This internship was funded by McGill University and supervised by BHL Program Director, Martin Kalfatovic. I further describe this project in a two-part blog series with BHL. See [Part 1](https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2021/11/understanding-bhl-through-metadata-patterns-of-bio-diverse-knowledge-production.html) and [Part 2](https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2021/11/geopolitics-of-metadata-knowing-panama-through-biodiversity-heritage-library.html).
The part of my dissertation concerning these files constitutes an analysis of metadata patterns in materials about Latin America in BHL's collection to identify shortcomings in the equitable representation of materials about Latin America, to recognize and counteract biases in the presence and importance of sites of knowledge production in the Global South versus the Global North, and to inform decolonizing strategies and policy. 
Data employed in this project were downloaded from [BHL's data website](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/data) as of July 1st, 2021, except for the file Bertholletia excelsa.csv (see SUBSETS DESCRIPTION). 

## FILE FORMAT

Each data file is a comma-separated values file (.csv) containing metadata categories for materials in BHL's collection that include one or more subjects related to Latin America in their subject lists. See the following sections in this file for information about the data found in each file.
Each row in a data file contains between two and thirteen columns. The first row in each file contains the column names. See the following sections in this file for information about the data found in each column. 

## FILE DESCRIPTION

All acronyms for subset names are indicated in parentheses in the next section of this file. 

1. SUB Lists.csv - csv file containing listed subjects per TitleID for all records (146806) that were part of BHL's collection as of July 1st, 2021.

2. Data files - csv files belonging to one of the following groups:
	+ Metadata subsets - csv files including full metadata details for the selected materials. The names of these files follow one of these three patterns:
	
		+ Subset acronym.csv
		+ Subset acronym - Unique.csv
		+ Species name.csv
		
		When the second pattern is used, only unique title IDs for the selected subject are included, i.e. works in volumes, issues, and/or numbers appear as a single record under their shared title ID. When the third pattern is used, the metadata included are the result of an online search by scientific name (included in the file's name) on BHL's catalogue. 

	+ Subject lists - csv files including only listed subjects per TitleID for the selected materials. The names of these files follow this pattern:
		
		+ Subset acronym - SL.csv
		
	+ Word frequencies - csv files including only the most frequent words in each subject list for the selected materials. The names of these files follow this pattern:
		
		+ Subset acronym - WF.csv
